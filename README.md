## 🐤 Flappy Bird – Simple Clone

A clean and simple Flappy Bird clone built for learning and practice.
The goal is straightforward: control the bird, avoid the pipes, and survive as long as possible.

## 🎮 How It Works

* Press **space / click** to make the bird jump.
* Avoid hitting the pipes.
* Each pipe passed = **1 point**.
* Game ends on collision.

## 🛠 Tech Used

* PYTHON
* Basic game physics (gravity + jump force)
* Collision detection
* Score tracking
